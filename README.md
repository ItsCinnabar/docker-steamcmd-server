# SteamCMD in Docker optimized for Unraid
This Docker will download and install SteamCMD. It will also install Stationeers and run it.

**Configuration:** To configure your server edit the file 'settings.xml' which lives in the main directory from the container (please don't forget to stop the container before editing the file).

**Update Notice:** Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.
